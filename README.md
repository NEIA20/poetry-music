This project will attempt to turn poems into instrumental music. 

It will need to be able to: 
1) assign words to musical notes 
    a. 
(skip potentially:  
    2) analyze the text of the poem for a sentiment analysis 
    to determine the instrument that is used to play the poem 
    and the theme of the view 
)
3) put together the notes and play them in an audio file
